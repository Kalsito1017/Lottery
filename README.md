#  Lottery Smart Contract Project

Welcome to the **Lottery Project**, a smart contract system built to simulate a decentralized lottery using Foundry, Solidity, and Chainlink services. This project demonstrates randomness, automation, and secure smart contract development.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Overview

This project contains a fully functional lottery dApp where:

- Users can enter the lottery by paying a fixed entrance fee.
- A random winner is selected at scheduled intervals using Chainlink VRF.
- Chainlink Automation (Keepers) handles the lottery execution lifecycle.

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Solidity** â€“ Smart contract development
- **Foundry** â€“ Smart contract development framework
- **Chainlink VRF & Automation** â€“ For randomness and automation
- **Hardhat (optional)** â€“ If testing or scripts are needed

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

 Note: Some external libraries (like Chainlink contracts) may not be included. Be sure to install them manually.
